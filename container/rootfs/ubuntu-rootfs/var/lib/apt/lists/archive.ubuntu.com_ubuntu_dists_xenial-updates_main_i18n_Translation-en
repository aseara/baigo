Description-en: font converter to generate console fonts from BDF source fonts
 This package provides a command-line converter that can be used in
 scripts to build console fonts from BDF sources automatically. The
 converter comes with a collection of font encodings that cover many
 of the world's languages. The output font can use a different
 character encoding from the input. When the source font does not
 define a glyph for a particular symbol in the encoding table, that
 glyph position in the console font is not wasted but used for another
 symbol.
 .
 When deciding about the position in the font for a particular glyph,
 the converter takes into account that in text video modes the video
 adapter copies the eighth column of the glyph matrix of symbols
 positioned in the pseudographic area to the ninth column. In order to
 create fonts for text video modes, the width of the glyph matrix of
 the source BDF font should be seven, eight, or nine pixels; otherwise the
 converter creates fonts suitable for framebuffer only.

 (fc-cache), a sample program to list installed fonts (fc-list), a program
 to test the matching rules (fc-match) and a program to dump the binary
 cache files in string form (fc-cat). It no longer makes fonts managed by defoma
 available to fontconfig applications.

Description-en: GObject introspection data for the libsoup HTTP library
 This package contains introspection data for the libsoup HTTP library.
 .
 libsoup uses the Glib main loop and is designed to work well with GTK+
 applications.  This enables GNOME applications to access HTTP servers
 on the network in a completely asynchronous fashion, very similar to
 the GTK+ programming model (a synchronous operation mode is also
 supported for those who want it).

 It can be used by packages using the GIRepository format to generate
 dynamic bindings.

 GnuPG 1.4 is the standalone, non-modularized series. In contrast to
 the version 2 series, shipped with the gnupg2 package, it comes
 with no support for S/MIME and some other tools useful for desktop
 environments, but also with less dependencies.
 .
 The gnupg package is built without libcurl. So it does not support
 HKPS keyservers. Install the gnupg-curl package if you want to use
 the keyserver helper tools built with libcurl and supporting HKPS.

 command line or in scripts.  Even if you don't want to use it, other packages
 on your system probably will.
 .
 The GNU family of grep utilities may be the "fastest grep in the west".
 GNU grep is based on a fast lazy-state deterministic matcher (about
 twice as fast as stock Unix egrep) hybridized with a Boyer-Moore-Gosper
 search for a fixed string that eliminates impossible text from being
 considered by the full regexp matcher without necessarily having to
 look at every character. The result is typically many times faster
 than Unix grep or egrep. (Regular expressions containing backreferencing
 will run more slowly, however.)

 users have been limited to the POSIX C APIs for manipulating regular
 expressions, and while regex does provide these APIs, they do not

 apps may not want to add dependencies on.
 .
 Features:
  * Both asynchronous (GMainLoop and callback-based) and synchronous APIs
  * Automatically caches connections
  * SSL Support using GnuTLS
  * Proxy support, including authentication and SSL tunneling
  * Client support for Digest, NTLM, and Basic authentication
  * Server support for Digest and Basic authentication
  * Basic client-side SOAP and XML-RPC support

 .
 If you wish to use this package to create a custom Linux kernel, then it
 is suggested that you investigate the package kernel-package, which has
 been designed to ease the task of creating kernel image packages.

 If you are simply trying to build third-party modules for your kernel,
 you do not want this package. Install the appropriate linux-headers
 package instead.

Package: llvm-3.8
Description-md5: e971ae25bca86cd8f4914ecf62f6301c
Description-en: Modular compiler and toolchain technologies
 LLVM is a collection of libraries and tools that make it easy to build
 compilers, optimizers, just-in-time code generators, and many other
 compiler-related programs.
 .
 LLVM uses a single, language-independent virtual instruction set both
 as an offline code representation (to communicate code between
 compiler phases and to run-time systems) and as the compiler internal
 representation (to analyze and transform programs). This persistent
 code representation allows a common set of sophisticated compiler
 techniques to be applied at compile-time, link-time, install-time,
 run-time, or "idle-time" (between program runs).
 .
 The strengths of the LLVM infrastructure are its extremely
 simple design (which makes it easy to understand and use),
 source-language independence, powerful mid-level optimizer, automated
 compiler debugging support, extensibility, and its stability and
 reliability. LLVM is currently being used to host a wide variety of
 academic research projects and commercial projects. LLVM includes C
 and C++ front-ends, a front-end for a Forth-like language (Stacker),
 a young scheme front-end, and Java support is in development. LLVM can
 generate code for X86, SparcV9, PowerPC or many other architectures.

Description-md5: 8342d6c225bf79a3363354369d97b4c4
Description-en: "Metal as a Service" is a physical cloud and IPAM
 MAAS runs a software-defined data centre - it turns a collection of physical
 servers and switches into a bare metal cloud with full open source IP address
 management (IPAM) and instant provisioning on demand.
 .
 MAAS controls the servers through IPMI or another BMC or  converged chassis
 controller such as Cisco UCS. It provides a full inventory  of components,
 and can install Ubuntu, CentOS or Windows very fast on any  server under
 its control. It can also track and provide DHCP and DNS for other devices
 on the network.
 .
 MAAS handles VLANs and fabrics that span many trunked switches, as well as
 the routing-centric infrastructure typically used for large-scale OpenStack
 or other scale-out deployments. MAAS manages IP addresses and provides APIs
 for address assignment and release. MAAS can also allocate IP addresses for
 containers on machines, and release them when the machine is repurposed. MAAS
 provides PXE, DHCP, DNS and other low-level  services to ensure the cluster
 works smoothly.
 .
 MAAS works with any configuration system, and is recommended by the teams
 behind both Chef and Juju as a physical provisioning system.
 .
 MAAS provides:
 .
  * Hardware inventory of servers
  * Dynamic provisioning based on name or attributes such as disk, RAM, cores,
    nics, networking, gpu’s or architecture
  * DNS and DHCP as needed
  * PXE boot services
 .
 This package is a metapackage which installs all of the separate components
 of MAAS on a single machine.

 The MAAS rack controller (maas-rackd) provides highly available, fast
 and local broadcast services to the machines provisioned by MAAS. You
 need a MAAS rack controller attached to each fabric (which is a set of
 trunked switches). You can attach multiple rack controllers to these
 physical networks for high availability, with secondary rack controllers
 automatically stepping to provide these services if the primary rack
 controller fails.
 .
 A common configuration is to have a rack controller in each rack, with
 a fast primary network interface to the rack switch and secondary
 network interfaces on one or two other nearby racks for high
 availability redundancy.

 ntpdate is a simple NTP client that sets a system's clock to match
 the time obtained by communicating with one or more NTP servers.  It
 is not sufficient, however, for maintaining an accurate clock in the

Package: wget
Description-md5: 63a4a740bcd9e8e94bf661e4f1806e02
Description-en: retrieves files from the web
 Wget is a network utility to retrieve files from the web
 using HTTP(S) and FTP, the two most widely used internet
 protocols. It works non-interactively, so it will work in
 the background, after having logged off. The program supports
 recursive retrieval of web-authoring pages as well as FTP
 sites -- you can use Wget to make mirrors of archives and
 home pages or to travel the web like a WWW robot.
 .
 Wget works particularly well with slow or unstable connections
 by continuing to retrieve a document until the document is fully
 downloaded. Re-getting files from where it left off works on
 servers (both HTTP and FTP) that support it. Both HTTP and FTP
 retrievals can be time stamped, so Wget can see if the remote
 file has changed since the last retrieval and automatically
 retrieve the new version if it has.
 .
 Wget supports proxy servers; this can lighten the network load,
 speed up retrieval, and provide access behind firewalls.
