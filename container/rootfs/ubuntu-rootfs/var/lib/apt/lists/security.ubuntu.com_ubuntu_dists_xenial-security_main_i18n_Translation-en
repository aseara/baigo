 libsoup uses the Glib main loop and is designed to work well with GTK+
 applications.  This enables GNOME applications to access HTTP servers
 on the network in a completely asynchronous fashion, very similar to
 the GTK+ programming model (a synchronous operation mode is also
 supported for those who want it).
 .
 The GNOME support library is used for features which are important to
 GNOME apps, but which require GNOME-specific libraries that non-GNOME
 apps may not want to add dependencies on.
 .
 Features:
  * Both asynchronous (GMainLoop and callback-based) and synchronous APIs
  * Automatically caches connections
  * SSL Support using GnuTLS
  * Proxy support, including authentication and SSL tunneling
  * Client support for Digest, NTLM, and Basic authentication
  * Server support for Digest and Basic authentication
  * Basic client-side SOAP and XML-RPC support
 .
 This package contains the GNOME support shared library.

 This package provides the source code for the Linux kernel version
 4.4.0.
 .
 This package is mainly meant for other packages to use, in order to build
 custom flavours.
 .
 If you wish to use this package to create a custom Linux kernel, then it
 is suggested that you investigate the package kernel-package, which has
 been designed to ease the task of creating kernel image packages.
 .
 If you are simply trying to build third-party modules for your kernel,
 you do not want this package. Install the appropriate linux-headers
 package instead.

 features before they are adopted into PostgreSQL proper:
 .
  adminpack      - File and log manipulation routines, used by pgAdmin
  btree_gist     - B-Tree indexing using GiST (Generalised Search Tree)
  chkpass        - An auto-encrypted password datatype
  cube           - Multidimensional-cube datatype (GiST indexing example)
  dblink         - Functions to return results from a remote database
  earthdistance  - Operator for computing the distance (in miles) between
                   two points on the earth's surface
  fuzzystrmatch  - Levenshtein, metaphone, and soundex fuzzy string matching

  _int           - Index support for arrays of int4, using GiST (benchmark
                   needs the libdbd-pg-perl package)
  isn            - type extensions for ISBN, ISSN, ISMN, EAN13 product numbers
  lo             - Large Object maintenance
  ltree          - Tree-like data structures
  oid2name       - Maps OIDs to table names
  pageinspect    - Inspection of database pages

  pgcrypto       - Cryptographic functions
  pgrowlocks     - A function to return row locking information
  pgstattuple    - Returns the percentage of dead tuples in a table; this
                   indicates whether a vacuum is required.

  seg            - Confidence-interval datatype (GiST indexing example)
  sepgsql        - mandatory access control (MAC) based on SELinux
  spi            - PostgreSQL Server Programming Interface; 4 examples of
                   its use:
                   autoinc    - A function for implementing AUTOINCREMENT/

                                integrity (foreign keys).  Note that this is
                                now superseded by built-in referential
                                integrity.
                   timetravel - Re-implements in user code the time travel

Package: wget
Description-md5: 63a4a740bcd9e8e94bf661e4f1806e02
Description-en: retrieves files from the web
 Wget is a network utility to retrieve files from the web
 using HTTP(S) and FTP, the two most widely used internet
 protocols. It works non-interactively, so it will work in
 the background, after having logged off. The program supports
 recursive retrieval of web-authoring pages as well as FTP
 sites -- you can use Wget to make mirrors of archives and
 home pages or to travel the web like a WWW robot.
 .
 Wget works particularly well with slow or unstable connections
 by continuing to retrieve a document until the document is fully
 downloaded. Re-getting files from where it left off works on
 servers (both HTTP and FTP) that support it. Both HTTP and FTP
 retrievals can be time stamped, so Wget can see if the remote
 file has changed since the last retrieval and automatically
 retrieve the new version if it has.
 .
 Wget supports proxy servers; this can lighten the network load,
 speed up retrieval, and provide access behind firewalls.

 and other Unix systems.  Samba can also function as a domain controller
 or member server in both NT4-style and Active Directory domains.
 .
 This package provides winbindd, a daemon which integrates authentication
 and directory service (user/group lookup) mechanisms from a Windows
 domain on a Linux system.
 .
 Winbind based user/group lookups via /etc/nsswitch.conf can be enabled via
 the libnss-winbind package. Winbind based Windows domain authentication can
 be enabled via the libpam-winbind package.

Description-md5: 3b2939568b438f9e1d0d01baa7cec9f8
Description-en: QEMU full system emulation binaries (s390x)
 QEMU is a fast processor emulator: currently the package supports
 s390x emulation. By using dynamic translation it achieves reasonable
 speed while being easy to port on new host CPUs.
 .
 This package provides the full system emulation binaries to emulate
 the following s390x hardware: s390x.
 .
 In system emulation mode QEMU emulates a full system, including a processor
 and various peripherals.  It enables easier testing and debugging of system
 code.  It can also be used to provide virtual hosting of several virtual
 machines on a single server.
